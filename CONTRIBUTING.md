# Contributing to the Contract SDK

The Contract SDK is an open-source project and contributions are welcome.

Please note that any changes will have to be of high-quality and, unless self-explanatory, be well documented. All tests in the project,
including tests in any sample apps, have to pass and new tests must be added for any new feature.

## Branch naming

Fixes should be named fix/<short description of issue>, for example fix/bad_error_message.

Larger pieces of work that are expected to be in progress for some time should be named wip/<description of changes>, for example wip/refactor_tests.
WIP stands for Work In Progress.

Huge new features can be named feat/<description of feature>, for example feat/recognize_reference_states.
The idea is that just by looking at the branch name we can estimate the size of the changes contained within that branch.

All new changes should be added from custom branches that are merged to main by way of a pull request. The pull request will have to be approved by one of the code owners.
